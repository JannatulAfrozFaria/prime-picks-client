The key difference lies in their appearance, packaging, and price. Generic medicines are usually less expensive because they do not carry the cost of research, development, and marketing that brand-name drugs do. Both generic and brand-name medicines are regulated by the FDA to ensure they meet the same safety and efficacy standards. When prescribed by a healthcare provider, generic medicines offer a cost-effective alternative without compromising on quality or performance.</p>

                                            Proper storage of medicines is crucial to maintaining their effectiveness. Most medicines should be stored in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight and moisture, such as in a medicine cabinet or drawer. Avoid keeping them in bathrooms, where humidity levels are high. Certain medicines, like insulin or some liquid antibiotics, need to be refrigerated. Always read the storage instructions on the medicine label. Keep medicines out of reach of children and pets. It's also important to store them in their original containers with the labels intact for easy identification.</p>

                                            If you miss a dose of your medication, the first step is to check the medicationâ€™s instructions or consult your pharmacist or healthcare provider. Generally, if it's close to the time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and take the next one as scheduled. Never double up on doses to make up for a missed one, as this can lead to overdose or unwanted side effects. For time-sensitive medications like antibiotics or heart medications, missing a dose can have more serious consequences, so it's important to seek guidance from a healthcare professional if you're unsure.</p>

                                            Before taking any over-the-counter (OTC) medicine with prescription drugs, it's essential to consult with your healthcare provider or pharmacist. Some OTC medicines can interact with prescription medications, potentially causing adverse effects or reducing the effectiveness of your treatment. For example, certain pain relievers, antihistamines, or cold medicines can interact with blood pressure medications or antidepressants. Always inform your healthcare provider about all the medications and supplements you're taking to ensure that there are no harmful interactions.</p>

                                        Taking expired medicine is generally not recommended. While some medicines may retain their potency after the expiration date, others can lose their effectiveness or even become harmful. The expiration date indicates the period during which the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of the drug. After this date, the chemical composition of the medicine may change, leading to reduced efficacy or unexpected side effects. If you have expired medicine, it's best to dispose of it properly and consult your pharmacist or healthcare provider for a replacement.</p>

All the data is being stored in MongoDB and being rendered from specific data collection created in MongoDB when needed. In the BackEnd/Server Side, create, read, update, delete -all of these operations have been executed. The AuthProvider Component has been created to implement the Login and Register Process with Firebase Authentication.
